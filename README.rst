django CMS Transfer
===================

|pypi| |build| |coverage|

**django CMS Transfer** is an **experimental** package that allows you to export
and import plugin data from a page or a placeholder. It does not support foreign
key relations and won't import/export related data, such as `media <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-transfer/issues/18>`_.

.. note:: 
        
        This project is endorsed by the `django CMS Association <https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/>`_.
        That means that it is officially accepted by the dCA as being in line with our roadmap vision and development/plugin policy.

Documentation
=============

The setting ``DJANGO_CMS_TRANSFER_SERIALIZER`` allows to register a custom json serializer. An example for an use case could be to subclass Django's build-in python serializer and let it base64-encode inline image data base64. 

See ``REQUIREMENTS`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-transfer/blob/master/setup.py>`_
file for additional dependencies:

|python| |django| |djangocms|


Installation
------------

For a manual install:

* run ``pip install djangocms-transfer``
* add ``djangocms_transfer`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
* run ``python manage.py migrate djangocms_transfer``


Customization
-------------

Following settings are available:

* **DJANGOCMS_TRANSFER_PROCESS_EXPORT_PLUGIN_DATA**:

  Enables processing of plugin instances prior to serialization, e.g.
  ``myapp.module.function``.

* **DJANGOCMS_TRANSFER_PROCESS_IMPORT_PLUGIN_DATA**:

  Enables processing of plugin instances prior to saving, e.g.
  ``myapp.module.function``.
  For example: set default-values for ForeignKeys (images for django_filer, ..)

As an example the combination of ``_PROCESS_EXPORT_PLUGIN_DATA`` and
``_PROCESS_IMPORT_PLUGIN_DATA`` lets you export and import the data between
different systems while setting the contents as you need it::

    # settings.py
    .._PROCESS_EXPORT_PLUGIN_DATA = "myapp.some.module.export_function"
    .._PROCESS_IMPORT_PLUGIN_DATA = "myapp.some.module.import_function"

    # custom functions
    def export_function(plugin, plugin_data):
        # remove child-plugins which can't be handled
        if plugin.parent_id and plugin.parent.plugin_type == "SomeParentPlugin":
            return None
        # change data
        if plugin.plugin_type == "SomePlugin":
            plugin_data["data"].update({
                "some_field": "TODO: change me",
            })
        return plugin_data

    def import_function(deserialized_object):
        some_related_object = MyModel.objects.first()
        for field in deserialized_object.object._meta.fields:
            # example of setting a default value for a related field
            if isinstance(field, ForeignKey):
                value = getattr(deserialized_object.object, field.attname)
                if field.related_model == MyModel and value is not None:
                    setattr(deserialized_object.object, field.name, some_related_object)


Running Tests
-------------

You can run tests by executing::

    virtualenv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r tests/requirements/base.txt
    python setup.py test

For code formatting, `black` is used. To automatically fix errors reported from
`black`, you can install it via virtualenv and
`pip install -r tests/requirements/base.txt`.
After this you just need to run `tools/black`.
